# Fixes Applied - October 28, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Graphs Not Working** ✅
**Problem:** SimpleTrendChart component wasn't rendering properly due to CSS issues

**Solution:**
- Fixed the chart bar rendering with proper height calculations
- Added gradient styling (`bg-gradient-to-t from-blue-600 to-blue-400`)
- Improved responsiveness with better spacing and tooltips
- Added scale labels (0% to max%) for better readability
- Increased chart height from 32 to 40 (120px inner height)
- Added hover effects for interactive feedback

### 2. **Back Button Missing** ✅
**Problem:** No way to return to home page from dashboard

**Solution:**
- Added a "← Back" button in the top-left of the dashboard
- Links back to home page (`/`)
- Uses outline variant for subtle appearance
- Positioned next to the dashboard title

### 3. **Dark Mode** ✅
**Problem:** No dark mode toggle available

**Solution:**
- Created new `ThemeToggle` component (`src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`)
- Added theme switcher with 🌙 (moon) and ☀️ (sun) icons
- Persists theme preference in localStorage
- Respects system preference on first visit
- Toggle button appears on:
  - **Home page:** Top-right corner
  - **Dashboard page:** Top-right corner next to page title
- Uses existing dark mode CSS variables from `globals.css`

### 4. **Kolkata Not Showing** ✅
**Problem:** Kolkata district was missing from the list

**Solution:**
- Added Kolkata to `districts-west-bengal.ts` with code `3217`
- Updated geolocation detection to use code `3217` for Kolkata
- Added note: Kolkata has limited MGNREGA activity and may not have comprehensive data
- Total districts now: **21** (including Kolkata)

## 🎨 Additional Improvements

### CSS Fixes
- Fixed typo: `bg-linear-to-b` → `bg-gradient-to-b` (proper Tailwind v4 syntax)
- Adjusted background opacity from `/40` to `/20` for subtler effect
- Improved chart accessibility with tooltips showing exact percentages

### UI Enhancements
- Better header layout with flexbox alignment
- Theme toggle uses rounded-full for circular button
