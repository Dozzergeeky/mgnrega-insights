- [ ] MongoDB Atlas metrics dashboard reviewed
- [ ] UptimeRobot configured for uptime checks
- [ ] Error tracking configured (Sentry optional)

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90 (Performance, Accessibility)
- [ ] API response times < 500ms
- [ ] Database query times < 100ms
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 2s
- [ ] Time to Interactive < 3s

### Security
- [ ] HTTPS enforced (no HTTP traffic)
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in client
- [ ] MongoDB connection secured with auth
- [ ] CORS headers configured for public API
- [ ] Input validation on all API routes
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs

### Data Sync
- [ ] Initial data sync completed successfully
- [ ] Scheduled cron job tested
- [ ] Fallback to mock data verified when API down
- [ ] MongoDB connection timeout working (10s)

## Testing Scenarios

### User Flows
- [ ] New user lands â†’ selects district â†’ views dashboard
- [ ] User clicks "Detect My District" â†’ auto-selects location
- [ ] User views historical trends â†’ sees 6-month chart
- [ ] User switches districts â†’ dashboard updates
- [ ] Mobile user â†’ responsive layout works

### Edge Cases
- [ ] MongoDB unavailable â†’ mock data displays
- [ ] data.gov.in API down â†’ cached data used
- [ ] Geolocation denied â†’ manual selection available
- [ ] Slow network â†’ loading states visible
- [ ] Invalid district code â†’ graceful error

### Load Testing
- [ ] 100 concurrent users â†’ response time acceptable
- [ ] 1000 requests/min â†’ no database bottleneck
- [ ] Sustained traffic â†’ no memory leaks
- [ ] Peak hours â†’ auto-scaling working (if Vercel)

## Documentation

- [ ] README.md updated with all features
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT.md reviewed and accurate
- [ ] API endpoint documentation complete
- [ ] Architecture diagram created (optional)
- [ ] Loom walkthrough video recorded
