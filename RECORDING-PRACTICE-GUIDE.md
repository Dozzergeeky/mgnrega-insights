## üí° Pro Tips for Recording Day

### **If Something Goes Wrong:**
1. **Don't panic** - Pause for 3 seconds, then redo the last sentence
2. **Browser lag** - Pause silently, wait for it to load, continue
3. **Wrong click** - Say "Let me show that again" and redo
4. **Forgot what to say** - Pause, glance at script, continue naturally
5. **Audio glitch** - Stop recording, start over (better than bad audio)

### **Energy Management:**
- ‚òï Have water nearby (not coffee - can make you jittery)
- üßò Take 3 deep breaths before starting
- üòä Smile while talking (it improves your tone)
- üéµ Vary your pitch and pace (monotone is boring)

### **Post-Recording:**
- ‚úÖ Watch the full recording once before uploading
- ‚úÖ Trim dead air at start and end
- ‚úÖ Add chapter markers in Loom
- ‚úÖ Set custom thumbnail (dashboard screenshot)
- ‚úÖ Add call-to-action: "Links below üëá"

- ‚úÖ No long pauses or awkward silences

### **Nice to Have:**
- ‚≠ê Professional tone and pacing
- ‚≠ê Confident delivery without reading verbatim
